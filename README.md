# Walking Reminder
### A little window used to remind me to get up and move around...

I have this setup as a scheduled task that runs every hour and reminds me to get up, stretch my legs, get a refill of 
my drinks and rest my eyes ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜«

Here are some gifs of the program:

*Here are links to both the gifs used ( [Duck gif](https://giphy.com/gifs/happy-walking-wings-3o7btLRcDoBW1RmyJi) & [Stick Man gif](https://giphy.com/gifs/animated-loop-walking-XGnWMiVXL87Xa/media)*, please don't sue ðŸ˜³

Currently, changing the gif is quite difficult and requires a recompile and also the wpfAnimations .dll adding to the .exe. 
You can do this by using [Costura.Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Costura "GitHub page for Costura Costura")
